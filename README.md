### Speed Dating data set
- use file **SpeedDating_preprocessing_models.ipynb** to replicate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling (note that we re-tuned our local models and improved the performance after the presentation, thus the outcome is different from the blob).
- data: **Speed_Dating_Clean.csv**

### ASHRAE data set
- use file **ASHRAE_preprocessing.ipynb** to replicate data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- use file **ASHRAE_models.ipynb** to replicate models.
- data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data 
- note: the file **ASHRAE_weather.ipynb** is attached for reference only. It contains the EDA on weather data and different approaches we tried to interpolate missing values. It is not required to run this file to replicate the outcome of our blog.
