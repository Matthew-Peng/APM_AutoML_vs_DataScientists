## The Death of Data Scientists - Will AutomML Replace Data Scientists?

This is the code to replicate the human data scientist's results of this post on Medium: https://medium.com/@leapingclam/the-death-of-data-scientists-c243ae167701

### Speed Dating data set
- use file **SpeedDating_preprocessing_models.ipynb** for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling (note that we re-tuned our local models and improved the performance after the presentation, thus the outcome is different from the blob).
- data: **Speed_Dating_Clean.csv**

### ASHRAE data set
- use file **ASHRAE_preprocessing.ipynb** to replicate data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- use file **ASHRAE_models.ipynb** to train models.
- please download the data set from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data 
- note: the file **ASHRAE_weather.ipynb** is attached for reference only. It contains the EDA on weather data and different approaches we tried to interpolate missing values. It is **not required** to run this file to replicate the outcome of our blog.
